details: This was my first (pseudo) project ever. This was my final project for my universitie's mandatory course on Object Oriented Programming With c++.
          Wrote all of the code myself which is why this 'project' is absolute garbage.
 
                (P.S: if you've looked at the code and are wondering why there are no object oriented principles  used literally anywhere even though
                      this was for an OOPS course, it's because I didn't/ don't know object oriented programming. )

Also, I got a B for the project, so that says a lot about my universitie's standards
